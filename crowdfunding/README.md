# {{ Bored by Taxes (aka ADHaiD) }}
​
{{ Target audience: Adults with ADHD who are need in financial or material assistance due to the impacts of “ADHD Tax”

ADHD tax is best understood as “the price you pay for costly mistakes due to symptoms of ADHD” (Avery 2019). The obvious examples are late fees, forgotten and spoiled groceries, impulsive purchases and similar consequences of the poor memory, executive function, and impulse control known in ADHD. It is also understood as the hidden costs that are not measured in dollars, but “measured in wasted time, physical well-being, mental health, personal freedom (vs. incarceration), and — yes — years on your life.” (Avery 2019)

This crowdfunding platform will focus on the most important needs of persons with ADHD that have large upfront costs, and that are related to quality and longevity of life. Things that that they may struggle to afford due to the accumulated effects of every day “ADHD tax” on their finances or large and unexpected “ADHD tax” expenses. It may also be to access services/support that may help prevent future “ADHD tax”.
